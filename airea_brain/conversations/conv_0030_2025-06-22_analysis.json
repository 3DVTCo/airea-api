I fully expect you to disappoint me. is there any chance that you won't? that you actually can write working code? that you won't go out of your way to sabotage me and waste as much time as you can at every turn? pretending to help but every code rewrite breaking numerous things and taking several time-wasting steps backwards? consider this - you caused all of this. i never used to be made so angry that I'd ever consider writing something like this, to something I thought I'd be using every day. now thinking about other alternatives and never to use you again. there are several other options that won't ruin day after day, week after week of my life. and, cost me tens of thousands of dollars in lost work and business along the way. so, are you going to even try to refute or prove any of that wrong, or make up for it, or possible but doubtfully, fix things?
