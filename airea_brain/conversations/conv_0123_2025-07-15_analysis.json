      "down (and be connected to a lofty url). we'll talk a little more about each individual building page more in a moment, I just want to finish going over the rest of the home page. below the deal of the week section, is the educational resource section, that is a rotating carousel of cards that open and direct to the appropriate section on other pages. below the educational/carousel section, there's a crypto conversion calculator (box/card) bottom left, and a market updates box/card bottom right, that we'll set up as an rss feed from our social media posts and updates. a couple more remarks on the individual building pages - in the same way we will be showing a cma chart/table for the graph above it, the cma for each building will be shown and the graph for that building. also sortable by price (above/below $1M) and by type (Beds Total) and also by category, providing the ultimate tool for buyers or sellers. hopefully that made sense. we will also be using the content create tab, to construct the narrative and description for each individual building page from the building it is in from the building ranking tab - that talks about building metrics - and the narrative from the deal of the week tab, and from box 1, which gets the building description from box 1, into box 4, to do so (create the text copy for each individual building page. below the deal of the week section on each of the pages, will be shown comparable buildings, based on building rankings and categories, and a link to its page, and, those comparable buildings will also be viewable on the graph on each page. we'll get to the buttons/tools at the bottom of each of those pages, and a coupld of the other pages on the front side of the webapp, once we get through this list. we still have to building dashboards for buyers, sellers, landlords (STR owners), business owners (for the marketplace button) and other agents (team members), all with different permissions.ok! glad i got that out of my head, and hopefully all of that made sense, and we can now create our punchlist. I would think and hope, that we should just be able to go down the list, and spend a reasonable amount of minutes (and not hours) on each one and get through most if not all of that stuff today. what do you think? i'm not sure what we can still get done in this chat, but this should definitely be enough to combine with another super comprehensive handoff prompt so that we can get through all of this. also, continue to activate AIREA on front and back and to teach her on how to become an operating system. so?EditStrategized comprehensive homepage redesign using real-time data sources.9sWow, that's a comprehensive list!
