      "in a React component?AIREA: In this log, the AIREA development team found that the critical error across multiple debugging sessions was \"cat is not defined at index-DaJPNrMX.js:285\". This indicates that the cat variable in a React component within the BuildingRankingsV2 module may be undefined during production deployment. The root cause of this issue has been confirmed to be due to an unintended dependency on require functions, which are not always present or accessible at runtime for certain components in AIREA's mini-markets module. The solution to the error would be to properly import and use the cat variable within BuildingRankingsV2, fixing the production build and deployment.EditDiagnosed undefined 'cat' variable causing BuildingRankingsV2 production error.2sAIREA is getting closer! She's understanding that there's an undefined 'cat' variable in BuildingRankingsV2 that's causing issues in production.
