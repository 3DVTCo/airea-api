I really do fucking hate you. but I also do not have any alternatives that won't set me back even farther, so its imperative that we get AIREA back up and running, so I can try to reconstruct all of the damage you have inflicted on me. check out this shitty ass prompt you wrote, that is certainly not going to be helpful enough or provide enough information for you to be able to help me, without me having to explain or bring you up to speed too.",
