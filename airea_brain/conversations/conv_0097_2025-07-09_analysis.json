This error suggests that a variable or function named 'cat' was being referenced but had not been previously defined in the code.To resolve this issue, I would recommend checking the context of where and how 'cat' is being used in the MiniMarketVisualization component. It might be necessary to define 'cat' before using it or ensure that the correct variable or function with that name has been imported if it comes from an external module. Additionally, a thorough review of Claude's changes since June 13, 2025, may help identify where and how this error was introduced.EditSearching for specific error information in debugging collection.2sThe user is asking me to query AIREA about a specific error in the debugging collection.
